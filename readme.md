# Server Side Calculator

Server Side Calculator is a project that relies on jQuery to make server requests (using ajax) and to display information dynamically on the DOM. It allows a user to input two numbers, select an operator, evaluate the expression, and clear the input fields. As the name implies, all the calculation is done on the server rather than the client.
